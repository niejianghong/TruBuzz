Pushwoosh Android SDK
=====================

The SDK contains Android source code together with Eclipse project.
Compiled version of the SDK (Pushwoosh.jar) is in the "build" folder.

The SDK includes Amazon support as well. If you compile SDK manually or add it to your project as a source code, please note that Amazon messaging library (*ext-libs/amazon-device-messaging-1.0.1.jar*) should be declared as "external" (aka non-exported) jar file.

The guilde for SDK integration is available on Pushwoosh website:
